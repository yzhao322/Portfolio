My name is Yan. I have a solid math backgound since I was a math major in college. I've been working for the past 3 years as customer service representative in banking industry. I'd really describe myself as a person with a verstile skill-set, a lot of integrity and a willingness to go the extra mile to stisfy a customer. But I feel puzzled about my future career. I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker. I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills. Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do. But anyway, I will try my best studying and become a good developr.
